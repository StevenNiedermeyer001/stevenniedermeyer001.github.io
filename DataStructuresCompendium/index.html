                <div>Hello, this website initially focused on sorting algorithms for data structures, but upon further inspection I realized I do not know enough about the data structures as is and will be using this website as a means to learn more about and implement data structures as well as everything you can do with them (including sorting algorithms)</div><br/>
                <div>My first idea after uploading this project to github is to implement a changelog of some sort as well as letting the user know what the next step is.</div>
